This a utility application to control monitor brightness with the F1, F2 keys. It utilizes DDC/CI, but this app doesn't have the freezing issues that similar aplications tend to suffer from.

This app also shows the **native** system UI when changing brightness! It uses the private `BezelServices` framework for this.

Needless to say, your monitor needs to support DDC/CI for this app to work.
